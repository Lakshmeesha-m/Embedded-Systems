Task 1: LED Blinking (Without Timers)

This task blinks two LEDs without using hardware timers.

LED1 blinks every 2 seconds

LED2 blinks every 3 seconds

A fixed 1-second delay is used, and software counters track elapsed time.
When the counter reaches the required value, the corresponding LED is toggled and the counter is reset.

Time is created by counting delays instead of using timers.
