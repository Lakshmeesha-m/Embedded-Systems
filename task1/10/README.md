Task 10: IR Sensor Security Trigger System

Expected Output:
When an object is detected, the LED starts blinking continuously and stops only after a reset button is pressed.

Methodology:
The IR sensor triggers a blinking loop using a flag variable. The reset button input clears the flag, stopping the blinking and resetting the system.
