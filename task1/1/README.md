Task 1: LED Blinking Using Delay

Expected Output:
The LED turns ON for 1 second and OFF for 1 second continuously.

The LED pin is configured as an output. The digitalWrite() function is used to turn the LED ON and OFF, with delay(1000) used between each state change to create a 1-second interval.
