Task 9: LED Control Using Push Button AND IR Sensor

Expected Output:
The LED turns ON only when both the push button is pressed and the IR sensor detects an object.

Methodology:
Both button and IR sensor inputs are read simultaneously. Logical AND (&&) operation is used to ensure the LED turns ON only when both conditions are true.
