Task 5: LED Brightness Fading Using PWM

Expected Output:
The LED brightness smoothly increases from minimum to maximum and then decreases back to minimum.

Methodology:
The analogWrite() function is used with PWM-supported pins. A loop gradually increases and decreases the PWM value to control LED brightness.
