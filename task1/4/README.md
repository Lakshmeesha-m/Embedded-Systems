Task 4: Running Light Using Three LEDs

Expected Output:
Three LEDs glow one after another from left to right in a repeating pattern.

Methodology:
All LED pins are set as outputs. Each LED is turned ON sequentially with a small delay, while the previous LED is turned OFF to create a running light effect.
