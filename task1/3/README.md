Task 3: Toggle LED Using Push Button

Expected Output:
Each press of the push button toggles the LED state (ON to OFF or OFF to ON).

Methodology:
The program detects a button press transition and toggles the LED state using a variable to store the current LED status. This avoids continuous toggling while the button is held down.
