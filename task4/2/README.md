Read the LDR sensor value every 200 ms using a timer interrupt. If the light intensity is below a threshold, turn ON an LED. Otherwise, turn it OFF. Print the LDR values to the Serial Monitor.
The LDR sensor is read periodically using a timer interrupt, and the LED state is controlled based on the light intensity while displaying readings on the Serial Monitor.
